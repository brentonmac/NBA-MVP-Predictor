# NBA-MVP-Predictor

This is my NBA MVP Predictor Project. The project takes in raw NBA data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats. From here, we clean and run the data through machine learning models to create a list of mvps based on the historic data. Note that this project was created in Google Colab, thus some of the import file code blocks may need to be modified to import the csv files and run the code.
